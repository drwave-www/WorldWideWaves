# Push Notifications Implementation Progress

## Session Started
- **Date**: 2025-11-05
- **Branch**: feature/push-notifications-favorites
- **Approach**: Hybrid (client-side for favorites only)

## Completed

### ✅ Phase 1: Shared Core (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Created NotificationTrigger.kt (sealed class with EventStarting, EventFinished, WaveHit)
- ✅ Created NotificationContent.kt (platform-agnostic content with localization keys)
- ✅ Created NotificationManager.kt (interface with expect/actual pattern)
- ✅ Created NotificationScheduler.kt (DefaultNotificationScheduler implementation)
- ✅ Created NotificationContentProvider.kt (DefaultNotificationContentProvider implementation)
- ✅ Created NotificationsModule.kt for Koin DI
- ✅ Updated SharedModule.kt to include notificationsModule
- ✅ Created 55 comprehensive unit tests (NotificationTriggerTest, NotificationContentProviderTest, NotificationSchedulerTest)

### ✅ Phase 2: Android Implementation (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Created AndroidNotificationManager.kt (WorkManager + NotificationCompat implementation)
  - Uses WorkManager for scheduled notifications
  - Uses NotificationCompat for immediate notifications
  - Unique work names: `notification_${eventId}_${trigger.id}`
  - ExistingWorkPolicy.REPLACE for updates
  - Tags work with `event_${eventId}` for batch cancellation
- ✅ Created NotificationWorker.kt (CoroutineWorker for notification delivery)
  - Resolves localization keys using Android resources
  - Handles deep links with PendingIntent
  - Error handling with Result.success()/failure()
- ✅ Created NotificationChannelManager.kt (Android O+ channel setup)
  - Channel ID: WAVE_EVENTS_CHANNEL
  - Importance: HIGH (time-sensitive)
  - Features: vibration, badges enabled
- ✅ Created NotificationManager.android.kt (actual function)
  - Returns AndroidNotificationManager from Koin DI
  - Uses WorkManager.getInstance(context)
- ✅ Updated AndroidManifest.xml
  - Added RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission (WorkManager persistence)
  - Added deep link intent filter (worldwidewaves:// scheme)
  - POST_NOTIFICATIONS already present (Android 13+)
- ✅ Created AndroidNotificationManagerTest.kt (12 unit tests)
  - Tests WorkManager job enqueueing
  - Tests unique work names format
  - Tests notification cancellation
  - Tests exception handling
  - Uses MockK for WorkManager mocking

### ✅ Phase 3: iOS Implementation (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Created IOSNotificationManager.kt (class-based, lazy UNUserNotificationCenter)
  - Uses UNTimeIntervalNotificationTrigger for scheduled notifications
  - Uses 0.1 second delay for immediate notifications (closest to instant on iOS)
  - Unique identifiers: `event_${eventId}_${trigger.id}`
  - Localization via titleLocKey and bodyLocKey (iOS resolves at delivery time)
  - Deep links stored in userInfo dictionary for SceneDelegate routing
  - Badge counter increments on notification delivery
- ✅ Created NotificationManager.ios.kt (actual function)
  - Returns IOSNotificationManager() directly (no Koin DI - iOS safety)
  - Follows SystemClock pattern for iOS safety
- ✅ Created NotificationPermissionBridge.swift (Swift-Kotlin interop)
  - @objc methods: requestNotificationPermission and checkNotificationPermission
  - Requests .alert, .sound, .badge permissions
  - Completion handlers dispatched to main thread
  - Comprehensive logging and error handling
- ✅ Created IOSNotificationManagerTest.kt (10 unit tests)
  - Tests instantiation (iOS safety check)
  - Tests notification identifier format
  - Tests content structure validation
  - Tests edge cases (empty args, multiple args)
  - Tests createPlatformNotificationManager
- ✅ Updated Info.plist
  - Added NSUserNotificationsUsageDescription
  - CFBundleURLTypes already present (worldwidewaves:// scheme)
- ✅ iOS safety verification passed (0 violations, 1 expected warning)

### ✅ Phase 4: Integration & Testing (COMPLETE)
- ✅ All 902 tests passing, no regressions
- ✅ Notification scheduling validated in simulation mode
- ✅ End-to-end notification flow verified
- ✅ Phase 3 committed

### ✅ Phase 5: Integration with Event Lifecycle (COMPLETE)
- ✅ NotificationScheduler integrated with favorite event handlers
- ✅ Sync notifications on app launch
- ✅ Cancel notifications on unfavorite/event deletion
- ✅ Wave hit immediate notifications on position change
- ✅ All tests passing

### ✅ Phase 6: Production Hardening (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ iOS safety verification passed (0 violations)
- ✅ Platform-specific testing complete
- ✅ Deep link routing implemented
- ✅ Permission handling (Android 13+ and iOS)
- ✅ 77 comprehensive unit tests (100% passing)

### ✅ Phase 7: Documentation (COMPLETE - November 5, 2025)
- ✅ Created `/docs/features/notification-system.md` (comprehensive feature guide)
  - Overview, architecture, 7 notification types
  - Eligibility criteria and simulation mode behavior
  - 32-language localization strategy
  - Platform details (Android WorkManager, iOS UNUserNotificationCenter)
  - Limitations and constraints
  - API reference and troubleshooting
  - 600+ line comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Updated `/CLAUDE.md` with Notifications System section
  - Key files with line references
  - Development guidelines
  - Testing requirements
  - Quick reference (140 lines added)
- ✅ Updated `.ai-progress-notifications.md` with Phase 7 completion

## Implementation Notes
- Using WWWSimulation.speed to check simulation eligibility (speed == 1 enables notifications)
- Following iOS safety patterns (lazy initialization, no DI in init blocks)
- Localization strategy: Keys in shared, resolution in platform workers
- Favorites-only keeps notification count under platform limits
- Fixed compilation issues: event.getLocation().resourceId.toString() for body args
- Tests use pure Kotlin mocks (no MockK dependency)
