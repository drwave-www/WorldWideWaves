I can see you already have a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for the WorldWideWaves project. Looking at the current content, it's already well-structured with all the essential sections you mentioned:

- Project overview with technology stack
- Mandatory development requirements with security patterns
- Performance considerations for KMM
- Error handling patterns
- Input validation requirements
- Critical asset protection
- Common issue prevention
- Learning protocol

The existing CLAUDE.md appears to be complete and follows best practices for a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile project with MapLibre and Firebase integration.

Is there a specific aspect of the CLAUDE.md you'd like me to enhance or modify? For example:
- Adding new security patterns
- Updating testing requirements
- Expanding the learning protocol
- Adding specific patterns for recent changes

Or would you like me to help with something else related to your WorldWideWaves project?
