I can see that the current CLAUDE.md file is already comprehensive and includes the core requirements you mentioned. Based on my analysis of the project structure, I can see that it already uses:

- Firebase (Crashlytics, Analytics) - as evident from the build.gradle.kts files
- MapLibre for mapping functionality - with dynamic feature modules for different cities
- Comprehensive security, performance, and testing patterns

The existing CLAUDE.md file effectively covers:

1. **Project Overview** - ✅ Complete with technology stack
2. **Mandatory Development Requirements** - ✅ Comprehensive security patterns for KMM + Compose
3. **Critical Asset Protection** - ✅ User data and configuration protection covered
4. **Common Issue Prevention** - ✅ Addresses memory leaks, performance, error handling, testing coverage, configuration management
5. **Learning Protocol** - ✅ Pattern recognition and confidence levels defined

The current file already includes the specific considerations you mentioned for:
- Security patterns for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile + Compose ✅
- Performance considerations ✅
- Error handling patterns ✅
- Input validation requirements ✅
- Testing requirements including UI, unit, integration, performance, and accessibility tests ✅

The existing CLAUDE.md file appears to be well-structured and comprehensive for the WorldWideWaves project. It already incorporates the core patterns needed for a KMM + Compose + Firebase + MapLibre application, with strong focus on security, performance, and testing that aligns with the project's needs.

The file is already at a HIGH confidence level and covers all the critical aspects you specified in your requirements.
