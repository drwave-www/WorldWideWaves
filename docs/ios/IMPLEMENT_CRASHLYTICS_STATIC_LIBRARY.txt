PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE - CRASHLYTICS STATIC LIBRARY IMPLEMENTATION

When ready to implement, give Claude this prompt:

===BEGIN PROMPT===

Implement the CrashlyticsBridge static library solution for iOS following the complete plan in:

docs/ios/CRASHLYTICS_STATIC_LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

Requirements:
1. Read the ENTIRE plan document first
2. Understand the problem (iOS apps can't export symbols to frameworks)
3. Generate complete Xcode static library project using Python script
4. Add full Gradle automation (multi-architecture builds, lipo, linking)
5. Create comprehensive XCTest unit tests
6. Write detailed architecture documentation
7. Integrate with existing build pipeline
8. Verify symbol resolution at every step (use nm command)
9. Test complete workflow (Debug, Release, Archive builds)
10. Ensure all 902+ existing tests still pass
11. Commit with detailed explanation

Key validation points:
- Symbol must be capital 'S' in Shared.framework: nm ... | grep "_OBJC_CLASS_\$_CrashlyticsBridge"
- Universal .a must contain all architectures: lipo -info libCrashlyticsBridge-universal.a
- Archive build must launch successfully on TestFlight

Do NOT skip any steps. This is a production-critical fix.

===END PROMPT===
