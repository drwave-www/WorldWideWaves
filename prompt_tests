I want you to code a complete test suite for android and for ios about the three different map screens :
- Event detail screen map : see the whole event map from the sky, no padding, no borders, no gestures
- Wave screen map : same as event detail screen but with an automatic continuous focus in order to zoom on user position + wave front
- Full map screen : a panning window over the event area where user can pan and zoom freely to a certain zoom amount, the viewport never show a single pixel out of the event area, the window can stick to the
edges and corners of the event area but never go out of these limits, it's possible to zoom in/out when sticked to a corner or an edge so that that the viewport window extend but never show a single pixel out of
 the event area, it has to be smooth, any move which violates the constraints must be unauthorized from the beginning, it must be possible to zoom out in order to see fully one of the dimensions (width or
height) depending on the format of the event area, the two buttons targetWave and targetUser must be functional
First write a full description of the features of the three maps from your understanding of the code.
We will test the exact same behavior on both platforms but we will have to code the tests twice, so think about a smart way to describe the features only once and to implement the platform-specific tests
elements.
We will review your document together before implementation.
