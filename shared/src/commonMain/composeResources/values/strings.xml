WorldWideWaves is an ephemeral mobile app with a visionary goal: to orchestrate a series of human waves that ripple through great cities, across countries, culminating in a final, awe-inspiring wave that spans the globe. Set to unfold over the span of one year, this initiative aims to transcend physical and cultural boundaries, fostering a sense of unity, community, and shared human experience.

At its core, WorldWideWaves is more than just an app—it's a global movement designed to bring people together in a display of solidarity and joy. By leveraging technology, WorldWideWaves will enable participants from around the world to join in these human waves in their cities, creating a powerful visual and emotional spectacle.

In essence, WorldWideWaves is an ambitious endeavor to harness the power of technology for a truly noble cause—connecting humanity in a celebration of unity, joy and collective action. Through each wave, participants will not only contribute to a global spectacle but also experience the profound impact of coming together as one.
