    <string name="infos_core_2">But this brief story could end sooner than expected. We are isolated in a vast a desolate universe. We destroy everything. We are selfish. We are cruel. We are greedy. We are blind. And we seek to dominate. But we are also capable of empathy, we create wonders, we are resilient, we can be altruistic.</string>
    <string name="infos_core_3">But we have little time. We have made so much progress.. We can build an alternative : a community of rights, of solidarity, of democracy. It's up to us!</string>

Let's gather around cities and countries, all over the world. Let's choose peace. Let's choose joy. Let's choose nature. Let's choose US.</string>
    <string name="infos_core_5">What if just one wave was enough to bring us together?</string>
    <string name="infos_core_6">WorldWideWaves is an ephemeral mobile app with a visionary goal: to orchestrate a series of human waves that ripple through great cities, across countries. Set to unfold over the span of one year, this initiative aims to transcend physical and cultural boundaries, fostering a sense of unity, community, and shared human experience.</string>
    <string name="infos_core_7">At its core, WorldWideWaves is more than just an app, it's a global movement designed to bring people together in a display of solidarity and joy, with shared values.</string>
    <string name="infos_core_8">By leveraging technology, WorldWideWaves will enable participants from around the world to join in these human waves in their cities, creating a powerful visual and emotional spectacle.</string>
    <string name="infos_core_9">In essence, WorldWideWaves is an ambitious endeavor to harness the power of technology for a truly noble cause, connecting humanity in a celebration of unity, joy and collective action. Through each wave, participants will not only contribute to a global spectacle but also feel and share with the world the profound impact of coming together as one.</string>

    <string name="faq">FAQ</string>
    <string name="faq_access">Access FAQ</string>

    <string name="faq_question_1">Why isn’t there an event in my city or country?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_1">We selected several dozen of the world’s most populous cities to create a meaningful global wave. Technical and operational constraints currently prevent us from supporting an unlimited number of locations. We aimed for broad representation across continents, cultures, and languages, which can never be perfect. We hope to add more cities over time.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_2">What are these continent flags?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_2">We created original, imaginary continent flags to help you quickly identify cities in the list and to reflect the spirit of unity championed by WorldWideWaves. These flags are not official and exist only in this app; they are not meant to offend or replace any national or cultural symbols. Since there are no official flags for geographic continents, we designed our own for clarity and fun. If you like them, feel free to use them.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_3">Who is behind WorldWideWaves?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_3">WorldWideWaves is a purely private initiative. There is no corporation, association, or government behind it. The creators wanted to offer a constructive way for people who wonder how they can help improve the world and living conditions, an attempt to bring all interested existing progressive and democratic efforts together under a peaceful, apolitical banner.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_4">Is this a commercial initiative?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_4">No. The app is entirely free. While its design and development required time and money from the creators, they receive no direct personal financial benefit in return from it.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_5">Can I contribute to the effort?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_5">Yes, volunteers are always welcome. The app’s code is open-source on GitHub, and you can reach the creators at worldwidewaves@proton.me (replies not guaranteed). The best way to help is to spread the word: share photos and videos from events using the suggested hashtags, contact local influencers to amplify the message, talk about it with your community, and most importantly, join the wave!</string>
