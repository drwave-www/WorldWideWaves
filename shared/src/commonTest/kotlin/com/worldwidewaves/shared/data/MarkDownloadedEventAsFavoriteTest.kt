/**
 * Tests for MarkDownloadedEventAsFavorite use case.
 *
 * ## Note
 * Full integration testing is performed via MapDownloadCoordinator tests and
 * manual end-to-end testing. This test file is a placeholder for future
 * unit tests when a proper mocking framework is available.
 *
 * ## Coverage (via integration tests)
 * - Successfully marks event as favorite when map download completes
 * - Handles missing events gracefully
 * - Idempotent behavior when event is already favorited
